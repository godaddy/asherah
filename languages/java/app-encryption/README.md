## Quick Start

```java
// Create a session factory
try (AppEncryptionSessionFactory appEncryptionSessionFactory = AppEncryptionSessionFactory.newBuilder("productId", "sample_code")
    .withMemoryPersistence() // in-memory metastore persistence model
    .withNeverExpiredCryptoPolicy()
    .withStaticKeyManagementService("secretmasterkey!") // hard-coded/static master key
    .build()) {

  // Now create an actual cryptographic session for a partition.
  try (AppEncryption<byte[], byte[]> appEncryptionBytes = appEncryptionSessionFactory.getAppEncryptionBytes("user123")) {

    // Now encrypt some data
    String originalPayloadString = "mysupersecretpayload";
    byte[] dataRowRecordBytes = appEncryptionBytes.encrypt(originalPayloadString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

    // Decrypt the data
    String decryptedPayloadString = new String(appEncryptionBytes.decrypt(dataRowRecordBytes), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
  }
}
```
You can also review the [Reference Application](../../../samples/java/reference-app), which will evolve along with the SDK 
and show more detailed usage.

## How to Use Asherah

### Setup Metastore
Detailed information on metastore can be found [here](../../../docs/Metastore.md). Java specific implementation examples are provided below.

#### Using a JDBC-compliant Metastore
Asherah supports the use of a standard JDBC DataSource for connection handling so that any JDBC-compliant connection pool can be used.
A simple example could be like:

```java
// Create / retrieve a DataSource from your connection pool
DataSource dataSource = ...;

// Build the JDBC Metastore
MetastorePersistence jdbcMetastorePersistence = JdbcMetastorePersistenceImpl.newBuilder(dataSource).build();
```

#### DynamoDB Metastore

```java
MetastorePersistence dynamoDbMetastorePersistence = DynamoDbMetastorePersistenceImpl.newBuilder().build();
```

#### In-memory Metastore (FOR TESTING ONLY)
Asherah also supports an in-memory metastore persistence model but that ***should only be used for testing purposes***.

```java
MetastorePersistence<JSONObject> metastorePersistence = new MemoryPersistenceImpl<>();
```

### Setup Key Management Service
Detailed information on KMS can be found [here](../../../docs/KeyManagementService.md). Java specific implementation examples are provided below.

#### AWS KMS
```java
// Create a map of region and arn that will all be used when creating a System Key
Map<String, String> regionMap = ImmutableMap.of("us-east-1", "arn_of_us-east-1",
    "us-east-2", "arn_of_us-east-2",
    ...);

// Build the Key Management Service using the region map and your preferred (usually current) region
KeyManagementService keyManagementService = AWSKeyManagementServiceImpl.newBuilder(regionMap, "us-east-1").build();
```

#### Static KMS (FOR TESTING ONLY)
The SDK also supports a static KMS but it ***should never be used in production***.

```java
KeyManagementService keyManagementService = new StaticKeyManagementServiceImpl("secretmasterkey!");
```

### Setup Crypto Policy
Detailed information on Crypto Policy can be found [here](../../../docs/CryptoPolicy.md). 
The Crypto Policy's effect on key caching can be found [here](../../../docs/KeyCaching.md).


#### Basic Expiring Crypto Policy
Here's how you can build a BasicExpiringCryptoPolicy:

```java
CryptoPolicy basicExpiringCryptoPolicy = BasicExpiringCryptoPolicy
    .newBuilder()
    .withKeyExpirationDays(90)
    .withRevokeCheckMinutes(60)
    .build();
```

#### Never Expired Crypto Policy (FOR TESTING ONLY)
This policy supports keys that never expire nor ever removed from the cache. This ***should never be used in the production environment***.

```java
CryptoPolicy neverExpiredCryptoPolicy = new NeverExpiredCryptoPolicy();
```

### (Optional) Enable Metrics
Asherah's Java implementation uses [Micrometer](http://micrometer.io/) for metrics, which are disabled by default. All metrics 
generated by this SDK use the [global registry](https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_global_registry) and 
use a prefix defined by `MetricsUtil.AEL_METRICS_PREFIX` (`ael` as of this writing). If metrics are left disabled, 
we rely on Micrometer's [deny filtering](https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_deny_accept_meters).

To enable metrics generation, simply use the final optional builder step `withMetricsEnabled()` when building a session factory:

The following metrics are available.
- *ael.drr.decrypt:* Total time spent on all operations that were needed to decrypt.
- *ael.drr.encrypt:* Total time spent on all operations that were needed to encrypt.
- *ael.kms.aws.decrypt.\<region\>:* Time spent on decrypting the region-specific keys.
- *ael.kms.aws.decryptkey:* Total time spend in decrypting the key which would include the region-specific decrypt calls in case of transient failures.
- *ael.kms.aws.encrypt.\<region\>:* Time spent on data key plain text encryption for each region.
- *ael.kms.aws.encryptkey:* Total time spent in encrypting the key which would include the region-specific generatedDataKey and parallel encrypt calls.
- *ael.kms.aws.generatedatakey.\<region\>:* Time spent to generate the first data key which is then encrypted in remaining regions.
- *ael.metastore.jdbc.load:* Time spent to load a record from jdbc metastore.
- *ael.metastore.jdbc.loadlatest:* Time spent to get the latest record from jdbc metastore.
- *ael.metastore.jdbc.store:* Time spent to store a record into jdbc metastore.
- *ael.metastore.dynamodb.load:* Time spent to load a record from DynamoDB metastore.
- *ael.metastore.dynamodb.loadlatest:* Time spent to get the latest record from DynamoDB metastore.
- *ael.metastore.dynamodb.store:* Time spent to store a record into DynamoDB metastore.

### Build Session Factory

Putting it all together, you can now build a session factory and get a session. This session can now be used for cryptographic operations.
```java
AppEncryptionSessionFactory appEncryptionSessionFactory = AppEncryptionSessionFactory.newBuilder("productId", "sample_code")
  .withMetastorePersistence(metastorePersistence)
  .withCryptoPolicy(policy)
  .withKeyManagementService(keyManagementService)
  .withMetricsEnabled() // optional
  .build();

AppEncryption<byte[], byte[]> appEncryptionBytes = appEncryptionSessionFactory.getAppEncryptionBytes("user123");
```

### Usage Styles

#### Custom Persistence via Load/Store methods
Asherah supports a key-value/document storage model. An [AppEncryption](src/main/java/com/godaddy/asherah/appencryption/AppEncryption.java) instance can accept a [Persistence](src/main/java/com/godaddy/asherah/appencryption/persistence/Persistence.java) implementation
and hooks into its `load` and `store` calls.

An example `HashMap`-backed `Persistence` implementation:

```java
Persistence dataPersistence = new Persistence<JSONObject>() {

  Map<String, JSONObject> mapPersistence = new HashMap<>();

  @Override
  public Optional<JSONObject> load(String key) {
    return Optional.ofNullable(mapPersistence.get(key));
  }

  @Override
  public void store(String key, JSONObject value) {
    mapPersistence.put(key, value);
  }
};
```

An example end-to-end use of the store and load calls:

```java
// Encrypts the payload, stores it in the dataPersistence and returns a look up key
String persistenceKey = appEncryptionJson.store(originalPayload.toJsonObject(), dataPersistence);

// Uses the persistenceKey to look-up the payload in the dataPersistence, decrypts the payload if any and then returns it
Optional<JSONObject> payload = appEncryptionJson.load(persistenceKey, dataPersistence);
```

#### Plain Encrypt/Decrypt Style
This usage style is similar to common encryption utilities where payloads are simply encrypted and decrypted, and it is 
completely up to the calling application for storage responsibility.

```java
String originalPayloadString = "mysupersecretpayload";

// encrypt the payload
byte[] dataRowRecordBytes = appEncryptionBytes.encrypt(originalPayloadString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

// decrypt the payload
String decryptedPayloadString = new String(appEncryptionBytes.decrypt(newBytes), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```


## Deployment Notes

### Handling read-only Docker containers

SecureMemory currently uses [JNA](link) for native calls. The default behavior of JNA is to unpack the native libraries from 
the jar to a temp folder, which can fail in a read-only container. The native library can instead be installed as a 
part of the container. The general steps are:

1. Install the native JNA package
2. Specify `-Djna.nounpack=true` so the container never attempts to unpack bundled native libraries from the JNA jar.

The following are distro-specific notes that we know about:

* **Alpine**
  * The native package is `java-jna-native`.

* **Debian**
  * The native package, `libjna-jni`, needs to be installed from the Debian testing repo as the current base image 
  is not compatible with AEL's JNA version. The example Debian Dockerfile listed below adds the testing repo before 
  installing this package and is then removed.
  * Add the property `-Djna.boot.library.name=jnidispatch.system` in java exec as Debian package contains an extra 
  ".system" in the library name.

* **Ubuntu**
  * The native package is `libjna-jni`.
  * Add the property `-Djna.boot.library.name=jnidispatch.system` in java exec as Ubuntu package contains an extra 
  ".system" in the library name.
  * If using the `adoptopenjdk/openjdk` base image, we need to add additional directories in the default library 
  path using `-Djna.boot.library.path=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jni/`

Our [test app repo's](../../../tests/java/test-app/) Dockerfiles can be used for reference: 
[Alpine](../../../tests/java/test-app/images/alpine/Dockerfile), [Debian](../../../tests/java/test-app/images/debian/Dockerfile) 
and [Ubuntu](../../../tests/java/test-app/images/ubuntu/Dockerfile) (uses [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/))

## SDK Development Notes

Some unit tests will use the AWS SDK, If you don’t already have a local [AWS credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html), 
create a *dummy* file called **`~/.aws/credentials`** with the below contents:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = foobar
aws_secret_access_key = barfoo
```

Alternately, you can set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
