# SecureMemory Java Edition

This class provides a way for applications to keep secret information (like cryptographic keys) in an area of memory
that is secure in the described ways.

## Installation

### Currently supported / tested platforms

* MacOS x86-64
* Linux x86-64

You can include SecureMemory in Java projects projects using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

The Maven group ID is `com.godaddy.asherah`, and the artifact ID is `securememory`.

You can specify the current release of SecureMemory as a project dependency using the following configuration:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.godaddy.asherah</groupId>
    <artifactId>securememory</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Quick Start

```java
SecretFactory secretFactory = new ProtectedMemorySecretFactory();

try (Secret secretKey = secretFactory.createSecret(getSecretFromStore())) {
  secret.withSecretBytes(bytes -> {
    doSomethingWithSecretBytes(bytes);
  });
}
```

## Goals

* Provide an interface which allows safe patterns of secrets usage
* Provide a handle for passing secrets around that doesn't expose the secret until it's actually used
* Minimize the lifetime of secrets in managed memory

## Guarantees

Any implementation must have the following guarantees in so far as secret information stored in secure memory
* Values stored will not show up in core dumps
* Values stored will not be swapped
* Values stored will be securely / explicitly zeroed out when no longer in use

## Protected Memory Implementation

The protected memory implementation of secure memory:
* Uses mlock to lock the pages to prevent swapping
* Uses mprotect to mark the pages no-access until needed
* If the operating system supports it, uses madvise to disallow core dumps of protected regions
* If the operating system does not support madvise, uses setrlimit to disable core dumps entirely

## Todo

* Add support for Cleaner rather than finalizer
* Add unit tests that generate core dumps and scan them for secrets (need to extract gcore source)
* If the operating system supports it, uses madvise to request that mapped pages be zeroed on exit
