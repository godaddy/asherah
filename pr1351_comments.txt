# Summary of Changes Made to Fix Lint Issues

## In securememory crate:

1. Fixed Debug trait implementations:
   - Added manual `Debug` impl for `StaticKeyManagementService` to redact sensitive info
   - Used appropriate Debug derives where needed

2. Fixed if-let scope issues for Edition 2024 compatibility:
   - Replaced if-let with match statements for better drop order preservation
   - This ensures consistent behavior across Rust editions

3. Fixed unseparated literal suffixes:
   - Changed 0u8 to 0_u8 for better readability throughout the codebase

4. Fixed lifetime naming:
   - Replaced single-character lifetimes ('a) with descriptive 'secret lifetimes
   - Fixed lifetime elisions for simpler code

## In appencryption crate:

1. Added #[derive(Clone)] to Aes256GcmAead:
   - Fixed compiler error in StaticKeyManagementService

2. Fixed unnecessary qualifications:
   - Used fmt::Debug instead of std::fmt::Debug
   - Added fmt import and used shorter qualifications
   - Made the code more concise and consistent

3. Replaced unwrap() calls with expect():
   - Added helpful error messages for all lock acquisitions
   - Improved cache implementations in LruCache, LfuCache, SimpleCache, SlruCache, and TlfuCache
   - Better diagnostics when errors occur

These changes bring the code in line with GoDaddy's recommended lint rules while maintaining the same functionality. The code is now more robust, with better error messages, proper Debug implementations, and consistent formatting.
