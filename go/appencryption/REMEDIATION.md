# Asherah Go Implementation - Remediation Guide

This document outlines critical issues found in the Asherah Go implementation that require remediation, organized by severity and impact on high-traffic production systems.

## Status

All previously identified issues have been resolved:

- ✅ **Nil Pointer Dereference**: Fixed in envelope validation
- ✅ **Resource Leak on Close Error**: Fixed in SessionFactory.Close()
- ✅ **Silent Error Swallowing**: Fixed with warning logs for metastore failures

## Testing Recommendations

- Add benchmarks for all hot paths with allocation tracking
- Implement stress tests with high concurrency
- Add fuzzing for error path handling
- Use race detector in all tests (`go test -race`)
- Add memory leak detection tests
