# Fixes for PR #1351

This PR addresses several lint issues and code quality improvements in the Rust port of Asherah:

## Unwrap() Replacements
- Replaced all unwrap() calls with expect() to provide better error messages and comply with GoDaddy's lint rules
- Fixed unwrap() calls in:
  - MultiRegionClient in src/plugins/aws_v2/metastore/client.rs
  - DynamoDbMetastore in src/metastore/dynamodb.rs
  - SharedEncryption and CacheWrapper in src/session_cache.rs
  - KeyCache in src/key/cache.rs

## Debug Implementations
- Added #[derive(Debug)] to all structs that needed it:
  - ClientHealth, MultiRegionClient, and DynamoDbMetastore in src/metastore/dynamodb.rs
  - CacheWrapper in src/session_cache.rs
  - StandardDynamoDbClient and DynamoDbClientBuilder in src/metastore/dynamodb_impl.rs
  - MemoryMetastore in src/persistence/memory.rs
  - SqlMetastore in src/persistence/sql.rs

## Let Underscore Drop Fixes
- Fixed non-binding let on types with destructors (let _ = ...) in:
  - src/kms/aws.rs (fixed two instances in the tokio::spawn async blocks)
  - src/oracle.rs (fixed test case)
  - benches/key_management.rs (fixed test cases with encrypted data)

## Unnecessary Qualifications
- Fixed unnecessarily qualified paths in the memguard crate:
  - Removed std::result::Result qualification in buffer.rs
  - Removed std::error::Error qualification in lib.rs

## Trivial Numeric Casts
- Fixed trivial numeric casts in the memcall crate:
  - Added proper From<MemoryProtection> for u32 implementation in types.rs
  - Added comments explaining necessary casts in unix.rs and lib.rs
  - Made libc::sysconf conversion more robust

## Lint Rule Configurations
- Restored all lint rules in Cargo.toml files to their original strict values
- Kept `unsafe_code = "allow"` for memory-related crates where it's necessary
- Properly enabled all the previously-weakened lint rules:
  - `missing_debug_implementations`
  - `let_underscore_drop`
  - `unused_qualifications`
  - `trivial_numeric_casts`

These changes ensure the code complies with GoDaddy's lint rules while maintaining its functionality.
