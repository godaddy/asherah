# Test Status Report

## Current Status

### ✅ Working (Library Tests)
All 14 library unit tests are passing:
- `cache::simple::tests` (5 tests) - Simple cache implementation
- `cache::slru::tests` (4 tests) - SLRU cache implementation  
- `cache_test::simple_cache_test` (1 test) - Simple cache integration test
- `partition::tests` (1 test) - Partition tests
- `plugins::aws_v1::tests` (1 test) - AWS v1 feature flags
- `envelope::encryption::tests` (2 tests) - Envelope encryption and key rotation

### ❌ Failing (Integration Tests)
Integration tests are failing due to:
- Missing import errors for `asherah` crate
- Missing `sqlx` dependency errors
- Type mismatch errors in mock implementations
- Unresolved module errors

### ❌ Failing (Examples)
Examples are failing due to:
- Missing `humantime` dependency
- Incorrect API usage (missing functions like `new_with_cache`)
- Missing parameters in constructors
- Incorrect method names

## Summary

The core library functionality is working correctly with all unit tests passing. The main issues are:

1. **Integration tests** need dependency updates and import fixes
2. **Examples** need to be updated to match the current API
3. Some warnings for unused imports and variables that can be cleaned up

The library is ready for use, but the integration tests and examples need additional work to be functional.
