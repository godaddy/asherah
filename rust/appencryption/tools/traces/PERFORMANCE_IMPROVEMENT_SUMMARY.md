# Performance Improvement Summary

## Initial State
- Go: ~354 ns per operation
- Rust: ~1,168 ns per operation (3.3x slower)

## Issue Identified
The Rust implementation was cloning the entire secret data on every `with_bytes` call:
```rust
let data = memory.clone(); // Expensive clone!
```

## Fix Applied
Removed the unnecessary clone and directly passed the memory reference:
```rust
result = action(memory);  // Direct reference like Go
```

## Current Performance
- Go: ~354 ns per operation  
- Rust: ~1,013 ns per operation (2.86x slower)

## Performance Improvement
- **15% improvement** from removing the clone
- Still ~2.86x slower than Go

## Remaining Performance Gap Analysis

The remaining performance gap comes from:

1. **Arc<Mutex<>> overhead**: Rust uses atomic reference counting and mutex locking, while Go uses simpler primitives
2. **More complex state management**: Rust has nested Options and more state tracking
3. **Function indirection**: Rust's trait-based approach may have more overhead than Go's direct function calls

## Next Steps for Parity

To achieve full performance parity, consider:

1. **Remove Arc if single-threaded**: Use `Rc` or direct ownership for single-threaded scenarios
2. **Simplify state management**: Remove unnecessary Option wrapping
3. **Inline hot paths**: Use `#[inline]` for frequently called functions
4. **Consider unsafe optimizations**: For the hot path, carefully use unsafe code to match Go's performance

## Conclusion

The clone removal provided a significant 15% improvement. The remaining gap is due to fundamental architectural differences between Rust's safety-focused design and Go's more direct approach. Further optimization would require architectural changes or selective use of unsafe code.
