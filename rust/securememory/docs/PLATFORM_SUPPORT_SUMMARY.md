# Platform Support Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the implementation of platform support for FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris in the SecureMemory crate.

## Implementation Files

The following files were created or modified:

1. Created platform-specific implementation files:
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/src/mem_sys/freebsd.rs`
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/src/mem_sys/netbsd.rs`
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/src/mem_sys/openbsd.rs`
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/src/mem_sys/solaris.rs`

2. Modified existing files:
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/src/mem_sys/mod.rs`: Updated to include the new platform-specific modules
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/Cargo.toml`: Added platform-specific features and dependencies
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/README.md`: Updated to reflect expanded platform support

3. Created documentation files:
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md`: Detailed information about platform support
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`: Notes on platform-specific implementations

4. Created test files:
   - `/Users/jgowdy/asherah/rust/securememory/tests/platform_specific_test.rs`: Tests for platform-specific code

## Implementation Details

### FreeBSD Implementation

The FreeBSD implementation uses:
- `MAP_NOCORE` flag during memory allocation
- `madvise` with `MADV_NOCORE` for additional protection against core dumps

### OpenBSD Implementation

The OpenBSD implementation uses:
- `MAP_CONCEAL` flag during memory allocation for enhanced security

### NetBSD and Solaris Implementations

The NetBSD and Solaris implementations use standard Unix memory management functions without platform-specific flags.

All implementations include:
- Memory allocation with `mmap`
- Memory protection with `mprotect`
- Memory locking with `mlock`/`munlock`
- Core dump prevention with `setrlimit`

## Testing

The platform-specific test verifies:
- Memory allocation and deallocation
- Memory protection (ReadWrite, ReadOnly, NoAccess)
- Memory locking and unlocking
- Core dump disabling

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been added to explain:
- Platform-specific features
- Implementation differences
- Memory management details
- Testing approach

## Future Work

Potential areas for future improvement include:
- Performance benchmarks on different platforms
- Additional platform-specific security features
- More extensive testing on actual target platforms

## References

The implementation was based on the Go memcall library and adapted to Rust's memory model and safety requirements.
