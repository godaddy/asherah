# Performance Regression Analysis

## Before Deadlock Fixes
From our earlier benchmarks, Rust was achieving:
- **WithBytes**: ~350-400 ns (similar to Go's 353.2 ns)
- **WithBytesFunc**: ~350-400 ns (similar to Go's 357.0 ns)

## After Deadlock Fixes
- **WithBytes**: ~1,159 ns (3.3x slower than before)
- **WithBytesFunc**: ~1,161 ns (3.3x slower than before)

## What Changed?

The main changes were:
1. Added `destroy_impl()` to avoid recursive locking
2. Modified registry to use `get_inner_ptr()` for comparisons
3. Changed `closed` to `Arc<AtomicBool>` for proper state sharing
4. Refactored to use `parking_lot::RwLock`

## The Culprit

The performance regression is likely due to:

1. **Arc<AtomicBool> overhead**: Every access now goes through an additional Arc indirection
2. **Extra synchronization**: The destroy_impl pattern may be adding unnecessary synchronization
3. **RwLock changes**: The switch to parking_lot::RwLock might have different performance characteristics

## Root Cause Analysis

Looking at the changes, the most likely culprit is the Arc<AtomicBool> change:

### Before:
```rust
struct ProtectedMemorySecret {
    inner: Arc<RwLock<SecretInner>>,
    closed: AtomicBool,  // Direct field
}
```

### After:
```rust
struct ProtectedMemorySecret {
    inner: Arc<RwLock<SecretInner>>,
    closed: Arc<AtomicBool>,  // Extra Arc indirection
}
```

Every check of the closed state now requires:
1. Arc dereference
2. Atomic load
Instead of just:
1. Atomic load

## Recommendations

1. **Revert to direct AtomicBool**: If possible, find another way to share closed state
2. **Profile the hot path**: Use perf or flamegraph to identify the exact bottleneck
3. **Consider alternative designs**: Maybe the closed state doesn't need to be shared via Clone
4. **Benchmark incremental changes**: Test performance after each change to isolate the regression

## Action Items

1. Create a benchmark to measure just the closed-state checking overhead
2. Try alternative implementations that avoid the Arc<AtomicBool>
3. Consider if the destroy_impl pattern is necessary or if there's a simpler solution
