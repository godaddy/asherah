## Quick Start
```c#
ISecretFactory secretFactory = new ProtectedMemorySecretFactory();

using (Secret secretKey = secretFactory.CreateSecret(secretBytes))
{
    secretKey.WithSecretBytes(bytes =>
    {
        DoSomethingWithSecretBytes(bytes);
    });
}
```

## Goals
* Provide an interface which allows safe patterns of secrets usage
* Provide a handle for passing secrets around that doesn't expose the secret until it's actually used
* Minimize the lifetime of secrets in managed memory

## Guarantees
Any implementation must have the following guarantees in so far as secret information stored in secure memory

Linux/Mac:
* Values stored will not show up in core dumps
* Values stored will not be swapped
* Values stored will be securely / explicitly zeroed out when no longer in use

Windows:
* Values are encrypted in memory
* Values stored will not be swapped
* Values stored will be explicitly zeroed out when no longer in use

## Secure Memory Implementation
This implementation of secure memory

* Uses mprotect to mark the pages no-access until needed
* If the operating system supports it, uses madvise to disallow core dumps of protected regions
* If the operating system does not support madvise, uses setrlimit to disable core dumps entirely

## Protected Memory Implementation
The protected memory implementation of secure memory

* Uses mlock to lock the pages to prevent swapping
* Uses mprotect to mark the pages no-access until needed
* If the operating system supports it, uses madvise to disallow core dumps of protected regions
* If the operating system does not support madvise, uses setrlimit to disable core dumps entirely

## TODO
* Add unit tests that generate core dumps and scan them for secrets (need to extract gcore source)
* If the operating system supports it, uses madvise to request that mapped pages be zeroed on exit
